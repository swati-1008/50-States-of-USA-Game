# 50-States-of-USA-Game

The game has been inspired by Sporcle.com, where a player can play a quiz game to list all the states of the USA, and once entered correctly, it is now shown on the physical map of USA (in the background image).

Python's turtle graphics library is used to write the state name here. In addition to it, pandas library is also used to create dataframe. This data frame consists of the list of states of US, and also its x and y coordinates on the screen.

The user is asked to enter the name of states on a text input, and the window's title shows the score that the user was able to achieve. Once the player lists all the 50 states, the game exits.

The game may also exit if the user simply writes exit. In this case, the player can go to a 'Missed States.csv' file in the current directory, which will show all the states that the user has missed.
